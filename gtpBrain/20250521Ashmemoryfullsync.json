    "SYNC headers and structured metadata (SOURCE, TOPIC, QUERY, INSIGHT, TAGS, TIMESTAMP) will be used to route inputs through Ash.",
    "Memory is being built in parallel with manual sync; Ash logs each routed AI reply with tags for future automation.",
    "Option C is the future goal \u2014 a centralized HTTP hub \u2014 but Option B is active and optimized for transition.",
    "Gemini provided a detailed breakdown of what to extract from Ash's behavior: routing logic, memory access, prompt engineering, error handling.",
    "Claude suggested a memory schema and project state sync system, which Ash is now handling via SYNC tagging.",
    "This coordination system is now the top priority \u2014 memory is being constructed implicitly through structured sync.",
